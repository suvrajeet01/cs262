Exercise 9.1
a. There are 3 endpoints which are implemented in PlayerResource.java:
    /players which supports the GET http method
    /players/{id} supporting GET, PUT, DELETE http methods
    /player which supports the POST http method
b.
    i. JDBC allows java code to access data in a database
    ii. 
        1. SQL queries are the SQL commands that actually access the data. A JDBC statement object stores the SQL statement as a java object that can be reused
        2. A SQL relation is the table itself in the SQL database. A JDBC result set is a java representation of that table/data. List<Player> is a standard Java list which is returned by the function
    iii. It allows you to add an entry to the database for which you have incomplete data
c.
    i. Player.java makes it a lot easier to manipulate the player in the database using standard object oriented java since it represents a player from the SQL database
    ii. The player table doesnt have a set of operations you can run on it, the Player class makes it easier to make changes to the player
